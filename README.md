4. **Questions:**

   - **Q. Which database have you chosen and why?**  
     **A.** I chose MongoDB since it was a small API and had no authentication requirement, so MongoDB was sufficient for it.

   - **Q. 3 things that you learned from this assignment?**  
     **A.**

     - How to use middleware in Mongoose (pre and post)
     - How to use regex in Mongoose
     - How to avoid data inconsistency when storing items

   - **Q. What was the most difficult part of the assignment?**  
     **A.** The middleware was the most difficult as I had no prior knowledge about it. It wasn’t extremely challenging, but it was new to me.

   - **Q. What would you have done differently given more time?**  
     **A.** I am fully satisfied with my submission; so, more time wouldn’t make a difference. Also, I am submitting well before the deadline.
